(1) Install "npx create-react-app ."

(2) Start the app with "npm start"

(3) Delete the the logo file as well as the code that pertains to the logo.

(4) Delete the default [app.css]

(5) Delete most of the [app.js] info

(6) Once you are ready to import {Links}, {Routes}, and {Route},
    install "npm i react-router-dom"

(7) In [App.js], set up your <header></header> with logo, company name, and login/registration buttons.
    (See [Header.js] file) (Because we will be importing this later.)

(8) In [App.js], set up the body of the home page. Include photos, buttons, links, etc.
    (See [Post.js] file) (Because we will be importing this later)

(9) Create [Post.js] and [Header.js] files.
    (a) Import the <body></body> into [Post.js]
            -In your function, after <main>, type:
            <Post />   


        -In [Post.js]:
            export default function Header(){
                return(
                    <body></body>
                );
            }

    (b) Import the <header></header> into [Header.js]
        -In [app.js], at the top of your code:
            import Header from './Header.js';
        -In your function, after <main>, type:
            <Header />   


        -In [Header.js]:
            export default function Header(){
                return(
                    <header></header>
                );
            }
(10) Format your [app.css] file as needed.

(11) Time to utilize your "npm i react-router-dom"! We are going to create links and make the login/registration functional. 

(12) In [app.js], you are going to:
    import {Route, Routes} from "react-router-dom";

(13) In [index.js], you are going to wrap <App /> with <BrowserRouter></BrowserRouter>.
